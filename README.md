# snow-inspector
The Snow Inspector is a web-based tool for inspecting the time series of snow cover at any point on Earth.
It is a Tethys App with a map and graph view.
When you select the location on the map, you can display the daily time series. Value 100% means complete snow coverage.
0% means no snow and the intermediate values mean incomplete snow coverage.

No data means that the location was covered by cloud on the given day and the snow coverage is unknown.

Planned Functionality:

Show time series of snow coverage from MODIS web map tiles
